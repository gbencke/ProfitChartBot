# ProfitChartBot

The main motivation for these project is the lack of an affordable api from nelogica in order to receive real time quotes from B3 exchange and then route orders to the exchange.

It works by scraping and doing an Screen OCR of the ProfitChart screen as we can see below and then sending the clicks via windows API to the buy / sell / close buttons
